# Governance

## Leadership Election

For most roles, candidates can self-nominate or be nominated
and are approved through consensus by the existing maintainers.

### Nomination Protocol

#### Submit Nomination for a New Maintainer or Role

The candidate or an existing maintainer creates a [maintainer nomination issue](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/maintainer_nominate.yaml) and submits a pull request (PR) to update the `MAINTAINERS.md`
or `ADVISORS.md` file by adding the nominee or reflecting the new role.

#### Voting

The PR requires approval from **at least three maintainers**.

For self-nominations, all three approvals must come from other maintainers.

For nominations by existing maintainers, the nominator's approval counts toward the three required.
Maintainers indicate their approval by approving on the PR.

#### Approval and Merge

Once the required approvals are met, the PR can be merged.

If the nominee is not yet added as a maintainer to the repository,
they should be added at this point,
officially confirming their maintainer status.

### Active Maintainer Definition

An **active maintainer** is a contributor who demonstrates ongoing commitment
to the Kepler project through regular participation and meaningful contributions.
Active maintainers are listed in the [`MAINTAINERS.md`](https://github.com/sustainable-computing-io/kepler/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md)
file to provide users with a reliable point of contact for project-related questions,
support, and collaboration.

Active maintainer will be reviewed on a 6-month cycle.

| **Cycle** | **Active Period**         | **Nomination / Review Period**       |
|-----------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Fall**  | October 1 – March 31      | August 1 – September 30              |
| **Spring**| April 1 – September 30    | February 1 – March 31                |

- Active maintainers are expected to maintain engagement during each cycle by providing tangible contributions in accordance with the [Active Engagement Expectations](#active-engagement-expectations).
- A designated person responsible for maintaining the maintainer list will create an issue during each review period to propose changes based on observed activity. This issue will remain open throughout the window, giving maintainers the opportunity to review and confirm their status.
- Maintainers who are not included in the proposed active list may respond or rebut (i.e., provide justification or recent contributions) to remain on the list.
- Maintainers who do not confirm their active status during the review period will be moved to the **Emeritus** list.
- **Emeritus maintainers** can return to active status in a future cycle by reaffirming their commitment to active participation.

This lightweight process helps streamline contributor engagement while maintaining an up-to-date and representative list of active maintainers.

#### Active Engagement Expectations

To help maintain a healthy and transparent governance process, the following example metrics can be used to demonstrate active involvement over a 6-month cycle. These are **guidelines**, not strict requirements:

- Volunteering for specific operational tasks such as:
  - Hosting community meetings
  - Triage and issue management
  - Release coordination or management
  - Triage and response to community questions in Slack channels
- Attending **more than 25% of community meetings** (e.g., at least 4 out of 12 calls within a cycle)
- Actively participating in **more than 3 triaged issues** (e.g., raising, commenting on, or resolving issues)
- Completing **more than 3 pull request reviews**
- Actively promoting the Kepler project in the community, such as:
  - Organizing a meetup
  - Writing a blog post
  - Giving a talk or presentation at an event

These metrics support transparency in participation and help ensure that active maintainers remain engaged and accountable to the community.

## Reviewer

A Reviewer has responsibility for specific code, documentation, test,
or other project areas.
They are collectively responsible, with other Reviewers,
for reviewing all changes to those areas and indicating whether
those changes are ready to merge.
They have a track record of contribution and review in the project.

Reviewers are responsible for a "specific area."
This can be a specific code directory, driver, chapter of the docs,
test job, event, or other clearly-defined project component
that is smaller than an entire repository or subproject.
Most often it is one or a set of directories in one or more Git repositories.

The "specific area" below refers to this area of responsibility:

### Responsibilities

- Following the reviewing guide
- Reviewing most Pull Requests against their specific areas of responsibility
- Helping other contributors become reviewers

#### Becoming a Reviewer

The contributor is nominated by opening a PR against the appropriate repository,
which adds their GitHub username to
one or more [OWNERS file](https://www.kubernetes.dev/docs/guide/owners/).

At least one member of the maintainers or the team
that owns that repository or main directory,
who are already Approvers, approve the PR.

## Advisory Committee

Advisory committee provides guidance for the overall direction of the Kepler
project, including but not limited to:

- Project roadmap
- Project governance
- Project releases
- Project marketing

Members of the advisory committee are expected to be active in the Kepler
community and attend the advisory committee meetings. Members are expected to
serve for a term of one year, with the option to renew for additional terms.

Members are invited and approved by the Kepler maintainers.

The current list of advisory committee is published and updated in
[ADVISORS.md](./ADVISORS.md).
